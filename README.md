RTL-Interactive-Push-Side-Menu
==============================

Push menu, works fine.

My issue is having the menu button way too clickalable even where it should'nt be
by that i mean that if hover with your mouse at the same height as the menu button but far from it
you will be able to click the button

any suggestion how to fix it?
I don't know if that's a CSS or JS issue

help will be appreciated
